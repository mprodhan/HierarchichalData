Welcome to the Science Fiction Gnere Tree, where some of the most popular science fiction shows
and their movies are listed in this MPTT or Modified Preorder Tree Traversal. This form of data
exists in the backend, however, SQL (Structured Query List) does not support a tree structured
data. On the other hand, the MPTT data type supports a way to use objects to be used as a way to
support file structures that contain data and consist of a path rooted from the parent to the
children. 

In this project, there is a file structure, in which the parent file is Sci-Fi and all of the shows
and its sub-children are part of the tree traversal. The parent contains its children, such as Star Trek, Doctor Who, Babylon 5, StarGate and with the possibility of more additions to the MPTT data type structure.
Here is a list of the Sci-Fi MPTT data structure:

It is fascinating how this is how practical that our operating systems work and then to develop it in webpage
format.
